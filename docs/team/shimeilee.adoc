Hi there! I am Shi Mei, a Year 2 Undergraduate studying in National University
 of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science.

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions to
_UltiStudent_, a software engineering project under CS2103T Software
Engineering module in NUS.

This project (_UltiStudent_) would not be possible without my amazing team
mates:
[underline]#{sourceDir}team/andrewscw.html[Andrew]#,
[underline]#{sourceDir}team/limzhengjiebenjamin.html[Benjamin]#, and
[underline]#{sourceDir}team/ngweixin.html[Xavier]#.

== Overview of UltiStudent


UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
their school life. To improve the quality of student life in computing, UltiStudent provides a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point (CAP) and notes.

Main Features of _UltiStudent_:

* Keep track of your deadlines from various modules (Homework Manager)
* Easy creation of digital notes (Notes Manager)
* Projection and Prediction of CAP (CAP Manager)

...without leaving the application!

== Summary of contributions

_This section is to provide a summary of my contributions to the project._

My main contribution for UltiStudent is the creation of the Notes Manager.

The photo below shows the homepage of the Notes Manager.

Notes Manager allows users of UltiStudent to: *Add and delete notes*, *save
and edit the content of their notes*, *find notes easily*, *list all their
notes*.

I was in charge of *Add*, *Delete*, *Find*, and *List* note commands.

* *Major enhancement*: Developed the logic, storage, and model components of
*the Notes Manager infrastructure*.

** What it does: allows the user to create and delete notes from the Notes
Manager.

** Justification: The ability to create notes depends on the Notes Manager
infrastructure. This improves the product significantly by allowing the
addition of other features such as Find, List, Edit, and Save.

** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be
added to the Notes Manager in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of
design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*:

** *Find note* command that lists all notes whose note name has the keywords
indicated by the user.

** *List note* command that lists all notes in the Notes Manager.
