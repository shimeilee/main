== PROJECT: UltiStudent

---

== Overview
UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having
too many applications to manage their school life by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.

UltiStudent is catered for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their
school activities through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

=== Major enhancement:
* Added the *ability to add homework* to homework manager through `add-hw` command.

** It allows the user to add homework to the homework manager. This feature is essential
and the foundation of homework manager as it enables homework manager to start keeping
track of user's homework.

** This functionality was a challenging as it requires an in-depth analysis
and understanding of AddressBook-Level4's UI, Logic, Model and Storage. A need to
understand how each component communicate with one another.

** *Credits*: AddressBook-Level4's add functionality was being used as a reference

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Most of the UI in UltiStudent
** Modified AddressBook's `add`, `delete` and `edit` command to guide users on what `add`,
`delete` and `edit` command UltiStudent has to offer.
