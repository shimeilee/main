Hi there! I am Ng Wei Xin (Xavier), a Year 2 Undergraduate of NUS majoring in Computer Science.

The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions to _UltiStudent_, a software
engineering project under CS2103T Software Engineering module in NUS.

UltiStudent would not be possible without my peers:
[underline]#{sourceDir}team/andrewscw.html[Andrew Sim]#,
[underline]#{sourceDir}team/limzhengjiebenjamin.html[Benjamin Lim]# and
[underline]#{sourceDir}team/shimeilee.html[Lee Shi Mei]#.

== Overview
UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having
too many applications to manage their school life by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.

UltiStudent is catered for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their
school activities through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

== Summary of contributions

* *Enhancement*:
** Added the *ability to add homework* to homework manager through the use of  `add-hw`
command.

*** It allows the user to add homework to the homework manager. This feature is essential
and the foundation of homework manager as it enables homework manager to start keeping
track of user's homework.

*** This functionality was a challenging as it requires an in-depth analysis
and understanding of AddressBook-Level4's UI, Logic, Model and Storage. A need to
understand how each component communicate with one another.

*** *Credits*: AddressBook-Level4's add functionality was being used as a reference.

** Added the ability to *edit and save note* for Notes Manager through the use of `edit-note`
and `save-note` command.

*** A core functionality for NotesManager.
*** This allows the user to edit the content of the empty note that was created using `add-note`.

*** *Credits*: AddressBook-Level4's select functionality was being used as a reference.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** 'open' command that opens the respective managers
** Most of the UI in UltiStudent
