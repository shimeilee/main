== Introduction
Welcome to UltiStudent!
UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
their school life. To improve the quality of student life in computing, UltiStudent provides a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.
UltiStudent is a desktop-based application intended for students.

// end::introduction[]

== Setting up
Do follow the instructions in order to set up our project on your device.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultistudent/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/ultistudent/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.ultistudent.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600", align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram_UltiStudent.png[width="800", align="center"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteHomework.png[width="800", align="center"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UltiStudentUiClassDiagram_updated.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultistudent/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are
 defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view`
 folder. For example, the layout of the
 link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultistudent/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`]
 is specified in link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::UltiStudentLogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultistudent/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `UltiStudentParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a homework).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteHomeworkSdForLogic_updated.png[width="800", align="center"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClass.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultistudent/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the UltiStudent data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Homework>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::UltiStudentStorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ultistudent/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the UltiStudent data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ultistudent.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::add-hw[]
=== Adding a homework: `add-hw`

|===
| _The add homework feature is a core feature to the Homework Manager of
 UltiStudent. Which allows the users to create a homework object in UltiStudent._
|===

==== Overview

The add homework `add-hw` mechanism is facilitated by `AddHomeworkCommand` and `AddHomeworkCommandParser`.
It takes in the following input from the user: `ModuleCode`, `HomeworkName` and `Date`, which will
construct individual objects that construct a `Homework` object.

The `AddHomeworkCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddHomeworkCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the
user that will create individual objects based on the prefixes 'mc/', 'hw/' and 'd/'. The `String`
value after the individual prefixes will create the respective object: 'mc/' for `ModuleCode`,
'hw/' for `HomeworkName` and 'd/' for `Date`. A validation check will be
imposed upon the creation
of each object. Any checks that fails the validation would prompt the user on the failed component.
For example:

** `ModuleCode` would use `ParserUtil#parseHomeworkModuleCode()` to ensure that user has input 2
letters followed by 4 digits with an option to include a optional letter after the 4 digits.

** `HomeworkName` would use `ParserUtil#parseHomeworkName()` to ensure that homework name is not a null.

** `Date` would use `ParserUtil#parseDate()` to ensure that user has entered a date that is either a
present or future date.

* After validation checks are completed with no errors, a `Homework` object is then constructed with
`ModuleCode`, `HomeworkName` and `Date` as the parameters

* `AddHomeworkCommandParser` would then return a `AddHomeworkCommand` object with the `Homework` as
the parameter

Take a look at the code snippet of AddHomeworkCommandParser below for an illustration:

.Code snippet for AddHomeworkCommandParser
image::AddHomeworkCommandParser snippet.png[width="800"]

==== Example
Given below is an example usage scenario of how `add-hw` mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019` to add a CS1101S Tutorial 1
homework with the deadline on 1st May 2019.

*Step 2*: `LogicManager` would use `UltiStudentParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

*Step 3*: `UltiStudentParser` would determine which command is being used and creates the respective
parser. In this case, AddHomeworkCommandParser is being created and the user's input would be pass in
as a parameter.

*Step 4*: `AddHomeworkCommandParser` would do a validation check on the user's input before creating
and returning a `AddHomeworkCommand` object with `Homework` as the parameter.

*Step 5*: `LogicManager` would use `AddHomeWorkCommand#execute()` to add the
`ModuleCode` and `Homework`
into the `Model` which is handled by `ModelManager`

*Step 6*: `AddHomeworkCommand` would return a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` which would then
be return back to the user.

The image below illustrates the scenario of when the user executes `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1
d/01/05/2019`:

.Sequential Diagram for `add-hw`
image::AddHomeworkSequentialDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::add-hw[]

// tag::deletehomework[]
=== Delete homework feature

This feature allows the user to delete a homework entry from the homework manager through its index.

The delete homework feature is facilitated by the `DeleteHomeworkCommandParser` and the `DeleteHomeworkCommand`.

The delete command is part of the <<Design-Logic,*logic*>> component of our application. It interacts with the
<<Design-Model,*model*>> and the <<Design-Storage,*storage*>> components of our application.

==== Overview

The `DeleteHomeworkCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `DeleteHomeworkCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `int` input from the
user which will delete the homework entry at the index which has entered.
Any invalid format of the command will be prompted by the command parser.

==== Current Implementation

The delete homework feature is executed by the `DeleteHomeworkCommand`. Currently, the
deletion of any homework entry is done based on the `INDEX` of the homework entry.

During the design of our delete function, we considered between two alternatives.

[width="800%",cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Design Consideration |Pros and Cons
|Deletion by Index (Current Choice) | *Pros:* Since each homework has a unique index,
any deletion by the index is less prone to bugs
and easier to implement.

*Cons:* User will have to scroll for the homework entry and look for its index which can be
inconvenient
|Deletion by Homework Name | *Pros:* It may be more intuitive for users to delete a
homework through the name of the homework.

*Cons:* Homework for different modules can have different names.
For example, two different homework entries for two different modules can be called 'Tutorial 1'.

|===

We have decided to opt for the first option primarily because it reduces the number of potential bugs and the
complexities involved when taking into account the different cases upon using deletion by homework name.

// end::deletehomework[]

// tag::edithomework[]
=== Edit homework feature

This feature allows the user to edit any attribute of the homework entries. This is a core feature because the user
may have to update deadline or make corrections to mistakes, such as typographical errors, when adding a homework entry.
There are a total of three attributes for each entry, the module code, the homework name and the deadline.
The user can edit at least one and up to three attributes.

The edit homework feature is facilitated by the `EditHomeworkCommandParser` and the `EditHomeworkCommand`.

The edit command is part of the <<Design-Logic,*logic*>> component of our application. It interacts with the
<<Design-Model,*model*>> component of our software architecture.

==== Overview

The `EditHomeworkCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `EditHomeworkCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in an `int` input and one to three `String` input(s) from the
user that will alter the attributes of current homework entries based on the prefixes 'mc/', 'hw/' and 'd/'.
The `String` value after the individual prefixes will alter the respective attribute it corresponds to:
'mc/' for `ModuleCode`,'hw/' for `HomeworkName` and 'd/' for `Date`. A validation check will be imposed upon editing
of each object. Any checks that fails the validation would prompt the user on the failed component.

==== Current Implementation

Here is an example of a step-by-step process on how the edit command alters an attribute of the homework entry.
For each step, you may follow the activity diagram at the end of this section to better understand the flow of events
within UltiStudent when an `edit-hw` command is inputted.

Step 1. The user launches the application and opens the homework manager. There is a list of existing homework entries
in the homework manager.

Step 2. The user then wishes to alter the homework deadline of the third entry in the homework list to 10 May 2019.
He then types `edit-hw d/10/05/2019` into the Command Line Interface (CLI) and executes it.

Step 3. The UltiStudentParser (refer to <<Design-Logic,*logic*>>) then reads in these attributes that have been inputted
and proceeds to alter the attributes of the homework entry in the given index. Each attribute will be validated.

Step 4. The UltiStudentParser then creates a new EditHomeworkCommand based on the input of the user.
When the EditHomeworkCommand is executed, it interacts with the Model architecture by calling the setHomework method.
The setHomework method replaces the current homework entry with the a new homework entry
containing all the desired attributes. The homework entry is now updated.

Step 5. If the module code for any homework entry has been edited to a module code that is not in the module code list,
the EditHomeworkCommand will add the new module code into the module code list.
The updated module code list will be displayed on our User Interface.

.Activity diagram for `edit-hw`
image::edit-hw activity diagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

In designing the edit homework feature, we considered if we should use an alternative data structure to update the
list of module codes. We considered using a hash map to map the module code to the number of homework with the modules
to check if the module code list has to be updated for each edit.


[width="80%",cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Design Consideration |Pros and Cons
|Update ModuleList by iteration (Current Choice) | *Pros:* Protects the abstraction layers and modularity
by restricting the usage to the existing data structures already present in our code.

*Cons:* Less efficient in terms of time and actual time taken can be long when number of entries is large.
|Update ModuleList using help from other data structures. | *Pros:* Faster expected performance.

*Cons:* Introducing a new data structure can disrupt the existing abstractions of our code.

|===

To sum up our justification of our choice of design, we decided to opt for the first option because we prioritised the
existing design abstractions in our code over the efficiency of our code.

// end::edithomework[]

// tag::findmodule[]
=== Find module feature

This feature allows the user to only display homework belonging to one or more module codes which is user has specified.
The find module feature is exceptionally useful to shorten the displayed list of homework.

The find module feature is facilitated by the `FindModuleCommandParser` and the `FindModuleCommand`.
It interacts with the <<Design-Model,*model*>> component of our architecture to retrieve the list homework.

==== Overview

The `FindModuleCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `FindModuleCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in at least one `String` input from the
user and display any of the homework entries with matches any of list of `[KEYWORDS]` that the user has inputted.
Each keyword is separated by a white space.
Any homework entry that matches with the list of keywords will be displayed on the homework list.

==== Current Implementation

The find module feature is facilitated by the `FindModuleCommand`.

Here is a sequence of steps on how the find module feature works. We will use an example here to help you understand the
flow of events. In the steps below, we will make references to the diagram at the end of the section to help
you visualise the sequence of events better.

Step 1. The user first launches the application and enters the homework manager. There are already existing
homework entries within the homework list.

Step 2. Currently, there are a total of twelve homework entries belonging to four modules.
(Do note that this is an arbitrary state of the storage in the homework manager and is meant to serve as an example.)
Now the user inputs `find mod CS1101S`. Referring to the diagram below, UltiStudentCommandParser
parses the command `find-mod` together with the list of keywords.

Step 3. The FindModuleParser then creates a FindModuleCommand and then returns it to the LogicManager,
which are illustrated by the blue arrows pointing from the command parsers back to the LogicManger.

Step 4. Now, the Logic Manager then executes this command. When the find command is executed, it called the method
updateFilteredList, which then returns a list of homework that has the module codes which matches any of the key words
inputted back to the Logic Manager as indicated by the purple arrows pointing back to the Logic Manager's blue block.

// tag::add_delete-note[]
=== Adding a note : `add-note`

|===
| _The add homework feature is a core feature to the Homework Manager of
 UltiStudent. Which allows the users to create a homework object in UltiStudent._
|===
==== Overview

The add note `add-note` mechanism is facilitated by `AddNoteCommand` and
`AddNoteCommandParser`.
It takes in the following input from the user: `ModuleCode` and `NoteName`
which will construct individual objects that construct a `Note` object.

The `AddNoteCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddNoteCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input
from the user that will create individual objects based on the prefixes
'mc/' and 'n/'. The `String` value after the individual prefixes will create
the respective object: 'mc/' for `ModuleCode` and 'n/' for `NoteName`. A
validation check will be imposed upon the creation of each object. Any checks
 that fails the validation would prompt the user on the failed component.

For example:

** `ModuleCode` would use `ParserUtil#parseNoteModuleCode` to ensure that user
has input 2 letters followed by 4 digits with an option to include a optional
 letter after the 4 digits.

** `NoteName` would use `ParserUtil#parseNoteName` to ensure that note name is not a null.

* After validation checks are completed with no errors, a `Note` object is then
constructed with `ModuleCode` and `NoteName`.

* `AddNoteCommandParser` would then return a `AddNoteCommand` object with
the `Note` as the parameter

==== Example
Given below is an example usage scenario of how `add-note` mechanism behaves at
each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `add-note mc/CS2103T n/Week 1 Lecture to
add a note for CS2103T Week 1 Lecture.

*Step 2*: `LogicManager` would use `UltiStudentParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

*Step 3*: `UltiStudentParser` would determine which command is being used and creates the respective
parser. In this case, AddNoteCommandParser is being created and the user's
input would be pass in as a parameter.

*Step 4*: `AddNoteCommandParser` would do a validation check on the user's input
 before creating and returning a `AddNoteCommand` object with `Note`
 as the parameter.

*Step 5*: `LogicManager` would use `AddNoteCommand#execute()` to add the
`ModuleCode` and `Note`
into the `Model` which is handled by `ModelManager`

*Step 6*: `AddNoteCommand` would return a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`
which would then be return back to the user.

The image below illustrates the scenario of when the user executes `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1
d/01/05/2019`:

.Sequential Diagram for `add-note`

=== Deleting a note : `delete-note`

This feature allows the user to delete a note from the homework manager through
its index.

The delete note feature is facilitated by the `DeleteNoteCommandParser` and
the `DeleteNoteCommand`.

The delete command is part of the <<Design-Logic,*logic*>> component of our application. It interacts with the
<<Design-Model,*model*>> and the <<Design-Storage,*storage*>> components of our application.

==== Overview

The `DeleteNoteCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `DeleteNoteCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `int` input from the
user which will delete the note entry at the index which has entered.
Any invalid format of the command will be prompted by the command parser.

==== Current Implementation

The delete note feature is executed by the `DeleteNoteCommand`. Currently,
 the deletion of any note entry is done based on the `INDEX` of the
 note entry.

During the design of our delete function, we considered between two alternatives.

[width="80%",cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Description of Implementation |Pros and Cons
|Deletion by Index (Current Choice) | *Pros:* Since each note has a unique
index within each list, deleting a note by its index is less prone to bugs
and will be easier to implement.

*Cons:* User will need to scroll for the entry and look for its index which
can be inconvenient.

|Deletion by Homework Name | *Pros:* It may be more intuitive for users to delete a
note through its note name.

*Cons:* Notes for different modules can have similar names.
For example, two different note entries for two different modules can be called
'Week 7 Lecture'. This may cause it to be more error-prone.

|===

We have decided to opt for the first option primarily because it reduces the number of potential bugs and the
complexities involved when taking into account the different cases upon using
 deletion by note name.


// end::add_delete-note[]

// tag::edit-note[]
=== Editing and Saving a note : `edit-note` `save-note`
|====
|These two feature allows the user to edit existing note and save them after editing.
|====

==== Overview
The `edit-note` command helps the user to open the selected notes to allow the user to start editing its content
by displaying all the content on the `NotesManagerMainPanel` which is a text field. It requires the need of the
`save-note` command to help save the user's edits

Below is an activity diagram of how the users use `edit-note` and `save-note` to facilitate adding contents to
their existing notes:

.(image description)
.Activity Diagram for `edit-note` and `save-note`
image::Edit&SaveNoteActivityDiagram.png[width=800]

*Step 1*: User will key in `edit-note INDEX` on the command line

*Step 2*: System will do a validation check to see if `INDEX` of note exist in the list of notes in the `Model`.
If note does not exist, it will throw a `ParserException` to the user. Else note will be opened and proceed to
step 3.

*Step 3*: Once it is opened, `NotesManagerMainPanel` will be enabled, allowing the user to start typing their
notes in the text field.

*Step 4*: When the user is done editing, he/she can use `save-note` in the command line to save the edited
content to the opened note.

*Step 5*: Upon successful save, `NotesManagerMainPanel` will be disabled and user will not be able to type
anything on `NotesManagerMainPanel`

==== Design Considerations

|===
|*Options*|*Pro*|*Cons*
|*1.* Users to type their content on the command line
|- Easy implementation +
 - Single source of input +
 - No need to handle special key press
|- Not user friendly +
 - Non-editable visual (textfield) +
 - Special commands for `NotesManager` to take in input from Command Line as note's content +
 - A need to convert from Command Line mode to Text Input mode
|*2.* Users to type their content on the `NotesManagerMainPanel`
|- User friendly +
 - A separate source of input +
|- Two sources of input, Command Line and TextField +
 - Harder implementation, requires handling of special key press
|===

Option 2 is being selected and implemented as we focus on the users convenience and the ability to edit their
notes easily. Separation of command line and notes text field would reduce the number of commands the user
has to remember and there will be lesser confusion of command line mode or text input mode.

// end::edit-note[]

// tag::edit-cap[]
=== Editing a Cap Entry : `edit-cap`
This feature allows the user to edit a cap entry from the cap entry list. Users can do so either via:
the cap entry's index with the `edit-cap` command or the cap entry's module code with the `edit-cap-mc`

==== Current Implementation
The `edit-cap` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application, UltiStudent.

The sequence diagram below shows how the editing of cap entries work when the user enters

.Reference Frame for Update Module Semester
image::EditCapManagerSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800", align="center"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how `edit-cap` behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user launches the application and opens the CAP Manager.

*Step 2*: There are already existing CAP entries. The user now executes `edit-cap 2 g/A sem/Y2S2` to edit the cap entry in the 2nd index with grade A and
moduleSemester of `Y2S2`.

*Step 3*: Upon executing this command, the `EditCapCommandParser` will take in all the arguments inputted and create a
`EditCapCommand` object. This object is then returned to the `Logic Manager` which will then execute the `EditCommand`

*Step 4*: When executing the `EditCapCommand` this alters the attributes of the CAP Entry in the UniqueCapEntryList object of
UltiStudent by setCapEntry(a,b) method, where `a` is the cap entry to edit, and `b` is the edited cap entry.
In doing so, this will call the method of `updateCapForDelete(a)` and `updateCapForAdd(b)`, which will update the CAP score.

*Step 5*: Next, the `UniqueModuleSemesterList` will be updated. This is done by the `updateModuleSemesterList(x,y)` where `x` is
the `moduleSemesterOfCapEntry` to edit, while `y` is the `moduleSemesterOfEditedCapEntry`.

*Step 6*: If `moduleSemesterOfCapEntry` is different from `moduleSemesterOfEditedCapEntry`, the `model` will check if it
contains `moduleSemesterOfEditedCapEntry`. If it does not, `moduleSemesterOfEditedCapEntry` will be added to
the `UniqueModuleSemesterList`.

*Step 7*: On the other hand, if the `model` does not have any cap entries with the same semesters as
`moduleSemesterOfCapEntry` after editing the cap entries, which is reflected if `hasCapEntriesWithSameSemester` is false.
The `moduleSemesterOfCapEntryToEdit` will be deleted to the `UniqueModuleSemesterList`.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to store the Cap Score.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the cap score as a static variable in CapEntry class.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Since a static variable belongs to the CapEntry class, there may be unintended side effects when we use commands
to modify the `UniqueCapEntryList`.
* **Alternative 2:** Store the cap score as a separate class that is then store in UltiStudent.
** Pros: Each versioned UltiStudent will have their own cap score.
** Cons: Will use more memory and is harder to implement.

===== Aspect: How to assign score for module grade.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a Hash Map to get the Store the cap score as a static variable in CapEntry class.
** Pros: Lower time complexity O(1) and cleaner code.
** Cons: Larger memory occupation.
* **Alternative 2:** Use switch cases to find and allocate score to grade.
** Pros: Easier readability.
** Cons: Slower time complexity, worst case of O(N).

//tag::delete-cap[]
=== Deleting a Cap Entry : `delete-cap`
This feature allows the user to delete a cap entry from the cap entry list. Users can do so either via:
the cap entry's index with the `delete-cap` command or the cap entry's module code with the `delete-cap INDEX`

==== Current Implementation
The `delete-cap` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application, UltiStudent.

The activity diagram below shows how the deleting of cap entries work when the user enters
`delete-cap`.

.Activity Diagram for `delete-cap`

image::DeleteCapManagerActivityDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how `delete-cap` behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `delete-cap 2` to delete the cap entry in the 2nd index.

*Step 2*: Upon executing this command, the `DeleteCapCommandParser` parses the arguments and checks if the arguments are valid.
If not valid, the command throws an exception and terminates.

*Step 3*: If the argument is valid, the command checks if the `CapEntry` exists in the CAP Manager. If it does, the entry is deleted.
The `UniqueCapEntryList` is then updated and the CAP score is updated as well.

*Step 4*: Check if after deleting the target `CapEntry` the `UniqueCapEntryList` still has a `CapEntry` of the same semester. If there is,
the module semester will be deleted from the `UniqueModuleSemesterList`. Then the `UniqueModuleSemesterList` will be updated.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.ultistudent.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.ultistudent.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.ultistudent.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.ultistudent.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, UltiStudent depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
