== Introduction
Welcome to UltiStudent!
UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having too many applications to manage
their school life. To improve the quality of student life in computing, UltiStudent provides a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.
UltiStudent is a desktop-based application intended for students.

// end::introduction[]

== Setting up
Do follow the instructions in order to set up our project on your device.

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.ultistudent.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600", , align="center"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteHomework.png[width="800", align="center"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UltiStudentUiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::UltiStudentLogicClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `UltiStudentParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a homework).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800", align="center"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClass.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the UltiStudent data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Homework>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::UltiStudentStorageClassDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the UltiStudent data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ultistudent.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::add-hw[]
=== Adding a homework: `add-hw`
|===
| _The add homework feature is a core feature to the Homework Manager of
 UltiStudent. Which allows the users to create
 a homework object in UltiStudent._
|===

==== Overview

The add homework `add-hw` mechanism is facilitated by `AddHomeworkCommand` and `AddHomeworkCommandParser`.
It takes in the following input from the user: `ModuleCode`, `HomeworkName` and `Date`, which will
construct individual objects that construct a `Homework` object.

The `AddHomeworkCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddHomeworkCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input from the
user that will create individual objects based on the prefixes 'mc/', 'hw/' and 'd/'. The `String`
value after the individual prefixes will create the respective object: 'mc/' for `ModuleCode`,
'hw/' for `HomeworkName` and 'd/' for `Date`. A validation check will be
imposed upon the creation
of each object. Any checks that fails the validation would prompt the user on the failed component.
For example:

** `ModuleCode` would use `ParserUtil#parseHomeworkModuleCode` to ensure that user has input 2
letters followed by 4 digits with an option to include a optional letter after the 4 digits.

** `HomeworkName` would use `ParserUtil#parseHomeworkName` to ensure that homework name is not a null.

** `Date` would use `ParserUtil#parseDate` to ensure that user has entered a date that is either a
present or future date.

* After validation checks are completed with no errors, a `Homework` object is then constructed with
`ModuleCode`, `HomeworkName` and `Date` as the parameters

* `AddHomeworkCommandParser` would then return a `AddHomeworkCommand` object with the `Homework` as
the parameter

Take a look at the code snippet of AddHomeworkCommandParser below for an illustration:

.(Figure description)
image::AddHomeworkCommandParser snippet.png[width="800", align="center"]

==== Example
Given below is an example usage scenario of how `add-hw` mechanism behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019` to add a CS1101S Tutorial 1
homework with the deadline on 1st May 2019.

*Step 2*: `LogicManager` would use `UltiStudentParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

*Step 3*: `UltiStudentParser` would determine which command is being used and creates the respective
parser. In this case, AddHomeworkCommandParser is being created and the user's input would be pass in
as a parameter.

*Step 4*: `AddHomeworkCommandParser` would do a validation check on the user's input before creating
and returning a `AddHomeworkCommand` object with `Homework` as the parameter.

*Step 5*: `LogicManager` would use `AddHomeWorkCommand#execute()` to add the
`ModuleCode` and `Homework`
into the `Model` which is handled by `ModelManager`

*Step 6*: `AddHomeworkCommand` would return a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager` which would then
be return back to the user.

The image below illustrates the scenario of when the user executes `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1
d/01/05/2019`:

image::AddHomeworkSequentialDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

// end::add-hw[]

// tag::deletehomework[]
=== Delete homework feature

This feature allows the user to delete a homework entry from the homework manager through its index.

The delete homework feature is facilitated by the `DeleteHomeworkCommandParser` and the `DeleteHomeworkCommand`.

The delete command is part of the <<Design-Logic,*logic*>> component of our application. It interacts with the
<<Design-Model,*model*>> and the <<Design-Storage,*storage*>> components of our application.

==== Overview

The `DeleteHomeworkCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `DeleteHomeworkCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `int` input from the
user which will delete the homework entry at the index which has entered.
Any invalid format of the command will be prompted by the command parser.

==== Current Implementation

The delete homework feature is executed by the `DeleteHomeworkCommand`. Currently, the
deletion of any homework entry is done based on the `INDEX` of the homework entry.

During the design of our delete function, we considered between two alternatives.

[width="80%",cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Description of Implementation |Pros and Cons
|Deletion by Index (Current Choice) | *Pros:* Since each homework has a unique index,
any deletion by the index is less prone to bugs
and easier to implement.

*Cons:* User will have to scroll for the homework entry and look for its index which can be
inconvenient
|Deletion by Homework Name | *Pros:* It may be more intuitive for users to delete a
homework through the name of the homework.

*Cons:* Homework for different modules can have different names.
For example, two different homework entries for two different modules can be called 'Tutorial 1'.

|===

We have decided to opt for the first option primarily because it reduces the number of potential bugs and the
complexities involved when taking into account the different cases upon using deletion by homework name.
// end::deletehomework[]

// start::edithomework[]
=== Edit homework feature

This feature allows the user to edit any attribute of the homework entries. This is a core feature because the user
may have to update deadline or make corrections to mistakes, such as typographical errors, when adding a homework entry.
There are a total of three attributes for each entry, the module code, the homework name and the deadline.
The user can edit at least one and up to three attributes.

The edit homework feature is facilitated by the `EditHomeworkCommandParser` and the `EditHomeworkCommand`.

The edit command is part of the <<Design-Logic,*logic*>> component of our application. It interacts with the
<<Design-Model,*model*>> component of our software architecture.

==== Overview

The `EditHomeworkCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `EditHomeworkCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in an `int` input and one to three `String` input(s) from the
user that will alter the attributes of current homework entries based on the prefixes 'mc/', 'hw/' and 'd/'.
The `String` value after the individual prefixes will alter the respective attribute it corresponds to:
'mc/' for `ModuleCode`,'hw/' for `HomeworkName` and 'd/' for `Date`. A validation check will be imposed upon editing
of each object. Any checks that fails the validation would prompt the user on the failed component.

==== Current Implementation

Here is an example of a step-by-step process on how the edit command alters an attribute of the homework entry.
For each step, you may follow the activity diagram at the end of this section to better understand the flow of events
within UltiStudent when an `edit-hw` command is inputted.

Step 1. The user launches the application and opens the homework manager. There is a list of existing homework entries
in the homework manager.

Step 2. The user then wishes to alter the homework deadline of the third entry in the homework list to 10 May 2019.
He then types `edit-hw d/10/05/2019` into the Command Line Interface (CLI) and executes it.

Step 3. The UltiStudentParser (refer to <<Design-Logic,*logic*>>) then reads in these attributes that have been inputted
and proceeds to alter the attributes of the homework entry in the given index. Each attribute will be validated.

Step 4. The UltiStudentParser then creates a new EditHomeworkCommand based on the input of the user.
When the EditHomeworkCommand is executed, it interacts with the Model architecture by calling the setHomework method.
The setHomework method replaces the current homework entry with the a new homework entry
containing all the desired attributes. The homework entry is now updated.

Step 5. If the module code for any homework entry has been edited to a module code that is not in the module code list,
the EditHomeworkCommand will add the new module code into the module code list.
The updated module code list will be displayed on our User Interface.


image::edit hw activity diagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

In designing the edit homework feature, we considered if we should use an alternative data structure to update the
list of module codes. We considered using a hash map to map the module code to the number of homework with the modules
to check if the module code list has to be updated for each edit.

[width="80%",cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Description of Implementation |Pros and Cons
|Update ModuleList by iteration (Current Choice) | *Pros:* Protects the abstraction layers and modularity
by restricting the usage to the existing data structures already present in our code.

*Cons:* Less efficient in terms of time and actual time taken can be long when number of entries is large.
|Update ModuleList using help from other data structures. | *Pros:* Faster expected performance.

*Cons:* Introducing a new data structure can disrupt the existing abstractions of our code.

|===

To sum up our justification of our choice of design, we decided to opt for the first option because we prioritised the
existing design abstractions in our code over the efficiency of our code.

//end::edithomework[]

//start::findmodule[]
=== Find module feature

This feature allows the user to only display homework belonging to one or more module codes which is user has specified.
The find module feature is exceptionally useful to shorten the displayed list of homework.

The find module feature is facilitated by the `FindModuleCommandParser` and the `FindModuleCommand`.
It interacts with the <<Design-Model,*model*>> component of our architecture to retrieve the list homework.

==== Overview

The `FindModuleCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `FindModuleCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in at least one `String` input from the
user and display any of the homework entries with matches any of list of `[KEYWORDS]` that the user has inputted.
Each keyword is separated by a white space.
Any homework entry that matches with the list of keywords will be displayed on the homework list.

==== Current Implementation

The find module feature is facilitated by the `FindModuleCommand`.

Here is a sequence of steps on how the find module feature works. We will use an example here to help you understand the
flow of events. In the steps below, we will make references to the diagram at the end of the section to help
you visualise the sequence of events better.

Step 1. The user first launches the application and enters the homework manager. There are already existing
homework entries within the homework list.

Step 2. Currently, there are a total of twelve homework entries belonging to four modules.
(Do note that this is an arbitrary state of the storage in the homework manager and is meant to serve as an example.)
Now the user inputs `find mod CS1101S`. Referring to the diagram below, UltiStudentCommandParser
parses the command `find-mod` together with the list of keywords.

Step 3. The FindModuleParser then creates a FindModuleCommand and then returns it to the LogicManager,
which are illustrated by the blue arrows pointing from the command parsers back to the LogicManger.

Step 4. Now, the Logic Manager then executes this command. When the find command is executed, it called the method
updateFilteredList, which then returns a list of homework that has the module codes which matches any of the key words
inputted back to the Logic Manager as indicated by the purple arrows pointing back to the Logic Manager's blue block.

// tag::add_delete-note[]
=== Adding a note : `add-note`

|===
| _The add homework feature is a core feature to the Homework Manager of
 UltiStudent. Which allows the users to create a homework object in UltiStudent._
|===
==== Overview

The add note `add-note` mechanism is facilitated by `AddNoteCommand` and
`AddNoteCommandParser`.
It takes in the following input from the user: `ModuleCode` and `NoteName`
which will construct individual objects that construct a `Note` object.

The `AddNoteCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `AddNoteCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `String` input
from the user that will create individual objects based on the prefixes
'mc/' and 'n/'. The `String` value after the individual prefixes will create
the respective object: 'mc/' for `ModuleCode` and 'n/' for `NoteName`. A
validation check will be imposed upon the creation of each object. Any checks
 that fails the validation would prompt the user on the failed component.

For example:

** `ModuleCode` would use `ParserUtil#parseNoteModuleCode` to ensure that user
has input 2 letters followed by 4 digits with an option to include a optional
 letter after the 4 digits.

** `NoteName` would use `ParserUtil#parseNoteName` to ensure that note name is not a null.

* After validation checks are completed with no errors, a `Note` object is then
constructed with `ModuleCode` and `NoteName`.

* `AddNoteCommandParser` would then return a `AddNoteCommand` object with
the `Note` as the parameter

==== Example
Given below is an example usage scenario of how `add-note` mechanism behaves at
each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `add-note mc/CS2103T n/Week 1 Lecture to
add a note for CS2103T Week 1 Lecture.

*Step 2*: `LogicManager` would use `UltiStudentParser#parse()` to parse the input from the user.

*Step 3*: `UltiStudentParser` would determine which command is being used and creates the respective
parser. In this case, AddNoteCommandParser is being created and the user's
input would be pass in as a parameter.

*Step 4*: `AddNoteCommandParser` would do a validation check on the user's input
 before creating and returning a `AddNoteCommand` object with `Note`
 as the parameter.

*Step 5*: `LogicManager` would use `AddNoteCommand#execute()` to add the
`ModuleCode` and `Note`
into the `Model` which is handled by `ModelManager`

*Step 6*: `AddNoteCommand` would return a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`
which would then be return back to the user.

The image below illustrates the scenario of when the user executes `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1
d/01/05/2019`:

.(Figure description)

=== Deleting a note : `delete-note`

This feature allows the user to delete a note from the homework manager through
its index.

The delete note feature is facilitated by the `DeleteNoteCommandParser` and
the `DeleteNoteCommand`.

The delete command is part of the <<Design-Logic,*logic*>> component of our application. It interacts with the
<<Design-Model,*model*>> and the <<Design-Storage,*storage*>> components of our application.

==== Overview

The `DeleteNoteCommandParser` implements `Parser` with the following operation:

* `DeleteNoteCommandParser#parse()` - This operation will take in a `int` input from the
user which will delete the note entry at the index which has entered.
Any invalid format of the command will be prompted by the command parser.

==== Current Implementation

The delete note feature is executed by the `DeleteNoteCommand`. Currently,
 the deletion of any note entry is done based on the `INDEX` of the
 note entry.

During the design of our delete function, we considered between two alternatives.

[width="80%",cols=2*,options="header"]
|===
|Description of Implementation |Pros and Cons
|Deletion by Index (Current Choice) | *Pros:* Since each note has a unique
index within each list, deleting a note by its index is less prone to bugs
and will be easier to implement.

*Cons:* User will need to scroll for the entry and look for its index which
can be inconvenient.

|Deletion by Homework Name | *Pros:* It may be more intuitive for users to delete a
note through its note name.

*Cons:* Notes for different modules can have similar names.
For example, two different note entries for two different modules can be called
'Week 7 Lecture'. This may cause it to be more error-prone.

|===

We have decided to opt for the first option primarily because it reduces the number of potential bugs and the
complexities involved when taking into account the different cases upon using
 deletion by note name.

=== Editing and Saving a note : `edit-note` `save-note`
// end::edit-note[]

// tag::edit-cap[]
=== Editing a Cap Entry : `edit-cap`
This feature allows the user to edit a cap entry from the cap entry list. Users can do so either via:
the cap entry's index with the `edit-cap` command or the cap entry's module code with the `edit-cap-mc`

==== Current Implementation
The `edit-cap` command is facilitated by the Logic and Model components of the application, UltiStudent.

The sequence diagram below shows how the editing of cap entries work when the user enters
`edit-cap`

.(figure description)

The sequence diagram for the "Update Module Semester" reference frame above can be seen below.

.(figure description)
image::EditCapManagerSequenceDiagram2.png[width="800", align="center"]

Given below is an example usage scenario of how `edit-cap` behaves at each step.

*Step 1*: The user executes `edit-cap 2 g/A sem/Y2S2` to edit the cap entry in the 2nd index with grade A and
moduleSemester of `Y2S2`.

*Step 2*: The user executes `edit-cap 2 g/A sem/Y2S2` to edit the cap entry in the 2nd index with grade A and
moduleSemester of `Y2S2`.

*Step 3*: The user executes `edit-cap 2 g/A sem/Y2S2` to edit the cap entry in the 2nd index with grade A and
moduleSemester of `Y2S2`.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to store the Cap Score.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the cap score as a static variable in CapEntry class.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Diffi
* **Alternative 2:** Store the cap score as a separate class that is then store in UltiStudent.
** Pros: Each versioned UltiStudent will have their own cap score.
** Cons: Will use more memory and is harder to implement.

===== Aspect: How to calculate score of module grade.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a Hash Map to get the Store the cap score as a static variable in CapEntry class.
** Pros: Lower time complexity O(1) and cleaner code.
** Cons: Larger memory occupation.
* **Alternative 2:** Use switch cases to find and allocate score to grade.
** Pros: Easier readability.
** Cons: Slower time complexity, worst case O(N).

*Step 1*: The user executes `edit-cap 2 g/A sem/Y2S2` to edit the cap entry in the 2nd index with grade A and
moduleSemester of `Y2S2`.

*Step 2*: The user executes `edit-cap 2 g/A sem/Y2S2` to edit the cap entry in the 2nd index with grade A and
moduleSemester of `Y2S2`.


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to store the Cap Score.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the cap score as a static variable in CapEntry class.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons:
* **Alternative 2:** Store the cap score as a separate class that is then store in UltiStudent.
** Pros:
** Cons: Will use more memory and is harder to implement.

===== Aspect: How to calculate score of module grade.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a Hash Map to get the Store the cap score as a static variable in CapEntry class.
** Pros: Lower time complexity O(1) and cleaner code.
** Cons: Larger memory occupation.
* **Alternative 2:** Use switch cases to find and allocate score to grade.
** Pros: Easier readability.
** Cons: Slower time complexity, worst case O(N).

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedUltiStudent`.
It extends `UltiStudent` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `UltiStudentStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedUltiStudent#commit()` -- Saves the current UltiStudent state in its history.
* `VersionedUltiStudent#undo()` -- Restores the previous UltiStudent state from its history.
* `VersionedUltiStudent#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone UltiStudent state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitUltiStudent()`, `Model#undoUltiStudent()` and `Model#redoUltiStudent()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedUltiStudent` will be initialized with the initial UltiStudent state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single UltiStudent state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800", align="center"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th homework in the UltiStudent. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitUltiStudent()`, causing the modified state of the UltiStudent after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `UltiStudentStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted UltiStudent state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add mc/CS2103T ...` to add a new homework. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitUltiStudent()`, causing another modified UltiStudent state to be saved into the `UltiStudentStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitUltiStudent()`, so the UltiStudent state will not be saved into the `ultiStudentStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the homework was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoUltiStudent()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous UltiStudent state, and restores the UltiStudent to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial UltiStudent state, then there are no previous UltiStudent states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoUltiStudent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoUltiStudent()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the UltiStudent to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `UltiStudentStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest UltiStudent state, then there are no undone UltiStudent states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoUltiStudent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the UltiStudent, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitUltiStudent()`, `Model#undoUltiStudent()` or `Model#redoUltiStudent()`. Thus, the `UltiStudentStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitUltiStudent()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `UltiStudentStateList`, all UltiStudent states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add mc/CS2101 ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire UltiStudent.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of UltiStudent states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.ultistudent.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.ultistudent.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.ultistudent.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.ultistudent.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, UltiStudent depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the UltiStudent, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the UltiStudent.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your UltiStudent application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.
****

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and AddressBookSystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/799[PR] for the full solution.

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the UltiStudent is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of persons when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleAddressBookChangedEvent(AddressBookChangedEvent)`] to update the number of persons whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/AddressBookSystemTest.java[`AddressBookSystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of persons status bar.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the UltiStudent to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the UltiStudent after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the UltiStudent storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the UltiStudent can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/AddressBookStorage.java[`AddressBookStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAddressBookStorage.java[`JsonAddressBookStorage`] class.
* Solution
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/594[PR] for the full solution.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
