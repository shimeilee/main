== Introduction

UltiStudent is for students who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing their school activities*.
More importantly, it is *optimized for students who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, it can not only help you to manage your homework but
also serve as a CAP calculator and Notes keeper!
