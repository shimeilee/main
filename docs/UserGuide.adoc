== Introduction

UltiStudent is a student application that effectively tackles the problem of having
too many applications to manage their school life by providing a centralised platform
for them to manage their homework, cumulative average point and notes.

UltiStudent is catered for students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their
school activities through a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Therefore if you can type fast, why not give UltiStudent a try to speed up your
management of school activities!

[[Features]]
== Features

UltiStudent consists of 3 key features to help you manage your student life:
Homework Manager, Notes Manager, CAP Manager.

=== HomeworkManager
Let this handy manager can help you to manage your homework by adding, deleting, editing your homework
based on your progress. You can also check on the deadlines of all your homework before
deciding which homework to attempt!

=== NotesManager
In this manager, you can add, delete, edit and save your notes here. Every note saved
here counts toward saving the environment by not using paper! Lets fight against global
warming! Fighting!

=== CAPManager
This manager will help you to record and keep track of your Cumulative Aggregate Points (CAP)!
Simply add, deleting and editing the grades for modules you have taken to see immediately what your updated CAP score is!
Not only that, you can even use the CAPManager to project future CAP scores!

This manager will always be your reminder to work hard and get
more 'A's for future modules! At the same time allows you to have an overview of your
completed modules which provides you the assistance you need to plan for your upcoming
semesters.

[[Commands]]
== Commands
As UltiStudent contains many different commands and features, do refer to the command
format below to help you better understand how to use each command to their best.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in
`add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/dd/mm/yyyy`, `MODULECODE` is a parameter which
can be used as `add-hw mc/CS2103T` but of course you would have to do the same for
`HOMEWORK` and `dd/mm/yyyy`.

* All parameters must be supplied by users: `add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/DEADLINE`.


=== General Commands
The commands here are applicable in UltiStudent's 3 Managers: HomeworkManager, NotesManager, CapManager.

The commands differ by the entity placed at the end of each command. `add-x`, `delete-x`,
`edit-x` where `x` should be replaced by either "hw" for homework, "note" for note,
or "cap" for cumulative average point!

==== Opening a manager : `open`
This command will usually be your first and frequently used command in UltiStudent! But fret not, I will teach
you on how to use this powerful command that is applicable to all Managers in UltiStudent.

To use this command, we have to adhere to this format: `open MANAGER` else UltiStudent would not be able to
understand what we are trying to tell it to do.

Example time!

Lets say we have a Homework to add, edit or delete, we can easily use `open HomeworkManager` to command UltiStudent
to open Homework Manager for us! Same goes for Notes Manager `open NotesManager` and Cap Manager `open CapManager`.

With this, we can begin our journey with UltiStudent to become an ultimate student!

==== Viewing help : `help`
Not sure how to get started? Not to worry! Simply type 'help' for more clarity!
Opens up the help window. +

Format: `help`

==== Listing entered commands : `history`
If you would like to review what you have done in your current session of UltiStudent, simply use our history command!
This command will help to retrieve the previously executed commands which has been entered into the system before `history`.



// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Accidentally made any mistake by entering a command with unintended effects? Don't worry!
Simply type undo and you will undo your latest changes in any of our managers. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the UltiStudent's content in
the various manager e.g. for Homework Manager
(`add-hw`, `delete-hw`, `edit-hw`).
====

Examples:

* `delete-hw 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +

* `delete-note 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-note 1` command) +

* `delete-hw 1` +
`add mc/CS2101 hw/Tutorial 1 d/03/03/2019` +
`undo` (reverses the `add` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Made an extra undo by mistake? Fear not! You can simply revert any of your undos by using our redo command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete-hw 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete-hw 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete-hw 1` command) +

* `delete-note 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.
// end::undoredo[]

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

When you are done with using UltiStudent, simply close it by using exit!
All of your entries will be safely stored on our application. +
Format: `exit`

==== Saving the data

UltiStudent data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to for you to save manually. It's easy to use!

=== Homework Manager
// tag::add-hw[]
==== Adding a homework: `add-hw`

Have a homework but unable to attend to it immediately? No worries! Let Homework Manager help
us keep track of them! By using `add-hw`, we can command this manager to remember our homework
for us! Make sure we are in the Homework Manager by using `open HomeworkManager` first.

Sadly, it doesn't do our homework for us... but hey it reduces our worries on forgetting our homework!

To use this command we have to adhere to this format: `add-hw mc/MODULECODE hw/HOMEWORK d/DEADLINE`
else Homework Manager would not be able to understand what we are trying to tell it to do.

[IMPORTANT]
DEADLINE must be in dd/mm/yyyy format and DEADLINE should not be a date that is before today! +
Homework are considered duplicated only if they have the same MODULECODE, HOMEWORK and DEADLINE.

Okay enough explanation and time for an example!

Lets say we have to do Tutorial 1 for CS1101S by 1st May 2019. We could command this manager to
remember it for us by using `add-hw mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019` in the command box (red highlighted box)
and do make sure that you are in the homework manager by checking if the Homework icon is highlighted in the
nagivation bar (white highlighted box) as shown below.

image::Add-Hw UG.png[width="790"]

When CS1101S tutorial 1 has been successfully added, the Result Box (green highlighted box) would display
`New homework added: CS1101S; Tutorial 1; 01/05/2019;`.

We will also be able to view the CS1101S being added into the Module List (blue highlighted box) since this
is the first homework for CS1101S we have and the Homework List (orange highlighted box) would show us the newly
added CS1101S homework.

[TIP]
Pro tip here! The ordering of `mc/MODULECODE`, `hw/HOMEWORK` and `d/DEADLINE` can be jumbled around!
so do not worry that this handy manager will not understand what you are trying to command it to do!

[CAUTION]
Sadly Homework Manager is english educated only... Therefore it only accepts english characters and numbers.
Maybe Homework Manager would be educated in other languages to accept other characters in future!

// end::add-hw[]

==== Editing a homework: `edit-hw`

Realised that you made a mistake in an entry after you added it? Introducing our edit command!
You can make any changes to any of the attributes of the homework entry using this command! +

To use this command, we must follow this format: `edit-homework INDEX  [mc/MODULECODE] [hw/HOMEWORK]
[d/DEADLINE]` You can refer to the diagram below to understand what we mean by the word `index`!
You may have noticed that it looks rather similar to the add-hw command. Good observation!
However, you should take note of the slight difference that you do not have to include all the attributes.
Instead, only include those you wish to change. Any other attribute(s) is optional.

Now let's take a look at an example so that you can understand what I mean more clearly.
So you already have a homework entry in the homework manager which has these
`mc/CS1101S hw/Tutorial 1 d/01/05/2019` as its attributes.
Now let's say our professor has decided to extend the deadline by a week upon requests by students.
Simply type `edit-hw 1 d/08/05/2019` and the update will be reflected in your homework entry.

image::edit-hw UG.png[width="790"]

After entering your `edit-hw` command, the message you see in the green highlighted box
in the diagram above indicates that you have successfully done it.
You can also see how the deadline of the attribute has been updated according to the deadline you wish to edit it to.

[TIP]
You can edit any amount of attributes at for one homework entry at one time!
Include all the attributes you want to alter based on the format
and exclude any other attributes you do not want to change.

==== Deleting a homework: `delete-hw`

Now let's say you are done with your homework and you wish to remove that entry from the homework manager.
You can easily delete it by using the `delete-hw` command!
All you have to do is to follow this short and simple format `delete-hw INDEX`.

Using the same example in the edit command. Let's say we are done with the CS1101S homework
and wish to remove it from the Homework Manager. All you have to do is to type `delete-hw 2` and you are done!

Our delete command is the shortest command in UltiStudent and the easiest to use.
If you happen to forget what we mean by the word `INDEX`,
simply refer to the diagram in the edit-hw section (Section 4.2.2) to understand what it means!

==== Finding homework from a specified module: `find-mod`

As we get later into the semester, there will be more work for us to do.
Every single module has some form of submission and you will soon have so many entries in your homework list
that it makes it difficult to read and find a particular entry.
We have a special command for you to use and find all the homework entries belonging to a specific module(s).

The format of this command is simple. `find-mod [KEYWORDS]`.
As you can see from the diagram below, after adding a module code as part of a keyword,
you will be able to see only homework from the module in the homework list.

image::find-mod UG.png[width="790"]

As you can see from the diagram above, even though there are a total of four modules with homework in the module list,
only homework from the modules CS1101S is shown after the common `find-mod CS1101S` is used.

[TIP]
You are not restricted to only one module code for the `[KEYWORDS]` in the command.
You can add more of them if you wish.

==== Reverting back to a full list view: `list-hw`

In the previous sub-section, we looked at how we can use the command `find-mod` to display
homework entries from selected module codes. Now, you are probably wondering now how to display a full list of modules.

To display the full list, simply use this command `list-hw`. This command has no additional inputs for you to type
and that makes this simple and easy to use!

=== Notes Manager
==== Adding a note : `add-note`
Adds a new note to the Notes Manager +
Format: `add-note mc/MODULECODE nn/NOTENAME`

Examples:

* `add-note mc/CS2103T n/NOTENAME`
* `add-note mc/CS2100 n/NOTENAME`

// tag::edit-note[]
==== Editing and Saving a note : `edit-note` `save-note`

===== Editing note: `edit-note`
Hurray! We've successfully added a note therefore it is time for us to learn how to edit and save the edited notes!
But first! we got to make sure we are in the Notes Manager by looking at the Notes icon in the Navigation Box (white
highlighted box) as shown below.

image::Edit&Save-Note UG.png[width="790"]

Now that we are in the Notes Manager. It is time for us to start editing our note! First off, we have to use
`edit-note INDEX` to select the notes that we want to edit.

For example, we have 2 notes currently as shown in the image above, and we would like to edit our Personal
Project Portfolio note. We will use `edit-note 1` in the Command Box (red highlighted box) to open *Personal
Project Portfolio* note for editing.

When Notes Manager has successfully open our note, it will display `Opened note: 1` in the Result box (green
highlighted box). At the same time, the note will be highlighted in blue in the Notes List (blue highlighted box)
and the Text Field (orange highlighted box) will be activated and turn white, allowing us to start jotting down
our notes!

===== Saving note: `save-note`

Now that we are done editing our note, it is time to save them! We can do this easily by using the `save-note` in
the Command Box (red highlighted box)!

Once the note is saved, Notes Manager will let us know by displaying `Saved note,  Module: CS2103T Note: Personal
Project Portfolio Content: ...(notes that we wrote)` in the Result Box (green highlighted box). At the same time,
the Text Field (orange highlighted box) will be disabled and turn grey.

For `save-note` there is no parameters as it will save all edited notes in notes manager.

[TIP]
Pro tip here! We can edit multiple notes at the same time by using edit-note 1 then edit-note 2 to open the
respective notes to edit. Once we are done editing, we can simply use `save-note` to save all the edited notes!

[CAUTION]
For data integrity, undo and redo commands are not supported on editing and saving notes.
Changes must be made manually.

// end::edit-note[]
==== Deleting a Note: `delete-note`

Deletes the specified note from the Notes Manager. +
Format: `delete-note INDEX`

****
* Deletes the Note at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed CAP Entries list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

****

Examples:

* `edit-note 1` +
Opens the 1st note in the Note Manager and allows editing into the note.

* `delete-note 2` +
Deletes the 2nd note in the Note Manager.


=== CAP Manager
Climbing to your first class honours? Or struggling to keep within your desired class? Worry no more, let CAP Manager
help you with keeping count. All you need to do is to key in your grades and TADAH your CAP will be calculated for you.
CAP Manager's interface is split into a few key sections. Do refer to the image below to familiarise yourself with
Cap Manager!

image::CapManagerInterface.png[width="790"]


Now that you're all set, let's see how Cap Manager can help us!

==== Adding a CAP entry: `add-cap`
Adds a new CAP entry to the CAP Manager +

Let's assume it's the end of the semester and you just got your grades back.
Simply add your modules to the Cap Manager with the `add-cap` command to view your updated CAP!

Format: `add-cap mc/MODULECODE g/MODULEGRADE mcs/MODULECREDITS sem/MODULESEMESTER`

[width="80%",cols="1,2,2",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Parameter |Input type |Example
|mc/MODULECODE |Module Code of the Module | mc/CS2103T
|g/MODULEGRADE |Module Grade received| g/A
|mcs/MODULECREDITS |Number of Modular Credits the module is worth| mcs/4
|sem/MODULESEMESTER |The Semester the module was taken in| sem/Y1S1

|=========================================================

Examples:

* `add-cap mc/CS2101 g/B+ mcs/4 sem/Y2S2`

Adds CS2101 into the CAP Manager, with a grade of B+ and 4 Modular Credits.

First open CAP Manager

image::OpenCapManager.png[width="790"]

Then use the `add-cap` command.

//image of added cap

And just like that your CAP Manager will now include the module you just added.
The semester list will also be updated if you are adding a module that is newly taken.
Not only that, your CAP score will be updated right away!


==== Editing a CAP Entry by index: `edit-cap`
If you made a mistake in entering the information for any particular CAP entry, do not worry!
 `edit-cap` command can easily fix that.

Edits an existing cap entry in the UltiStudent by the use of index. +
Format: `edit-cap INDEX  [mc/MODULECODE] [g/MODULEGRADE] [mcs/MODULECREDITS] [sem/MODULESEMESTER]`
****
* Edits the CAP entry at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed CAP Entries list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

****

Examples:

* `edit-cap 1 g/A` +
 Edits the module grade of the 1st cap entry in cap manager to be `A`
* `edit-cap 3 mc/CS2102 g/B+` +
Edits the module code of the 3rd cap entry and the grade obtained to `B+`.

==== Editing a CAP Entry by module code: `edit-cap-mc`
UltiStudent understands that students have to take many modules in their University life, as such,

As such the `edit-cap-mc` allows users to edit the parameters of a __ by the using the module code instead of the index
for more convenience!

Format: `edit-cap-mc MODULECODE [mc/MODULECODE] [g/MODULEGRADE] [mcs/MODULECREDITS] [sem/MODULESEMESTER]`
****
* Edits the CAP entry with the specified MODULECODE. The module code *must* be valid.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

****

Examples:

* `edit-cap-mc CS2100 g/B-` +
 Edits the module grade of CS2100 in cap manager to be `B-`
* `edit-cap CS2103T mc/CS2102 g/A+` +
Edits the cap entry of CS2103T to become that of a cap entry for CS2102 and sets the grade obtained to `B+`.

==== Deleting a CAP entry: `delete-cap`

If you ever do need to delete a CAP entry in the CAP Manager, you may use this command to easily delete that specific CAP Entry.
After executing the command
Deletes the specified CAP entry from the CAP Manager. +
Format: `delete-cap INDEX`

****
* Deletes the CAP entry at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed CAP Entries list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...

****

Examples:

* `delete-cap 2` +
Deletes the 2nd CAP Entry in the UltiStudent.

==== Filtering a CAP entry: `find-sem`

If you would like to view the modules you have taken for particular semester(s), then find-sem will be handy!

Format: `find-sem SEMESTER ...`

//warning: do note that cap score does not update such that it only calculates the CAP score for the modules displayed
// using the find-sem method. The cap score is stil that for all the modules in the cap entry.
// if you wish to exist, refer to list command

==== Filtering a CAP entry: `list-cap`

This command displays all the modules inside the CAP manager.
This command is most helpful after the use of `find-sem` command.

Format: `list-cap`
